## Codelab helps to understand below mentioned topics

- [**Paging Library:**][1] The Paging Library makes it easier for you to load data on demand within your app's RecyclerView.

- [**PagedList:**][2] Collection that loads data in pages, asynchronously. A PagedList can be used to load data from sources you define, and present it easily in your UI with a RecyclerView.
- [**DataSource**][3] and [**DataSource.Factory:**][4] DataSource is the base class for loading snapshots of data into a PagedList. A DataSource.Factory is used to create a DataSource.

- [**LivePagedListBuilder:**][5] Class used to build a LiveData<PagedList> based on DataSource.Factory and a PagedList.Config.

- [**BoundaryCallback:**][6] Helper callback to signals when a PagedList has reached the end of available data.
- [**PagedListAdapter:**][7] RecyclerView.Adapter that presents paged data from PagedLists in a RecyclerView. PagedListAdapter listens to PagedList loading callbacks as pages are loaded, and uses DiffUtil to compute fine grained updates as new PagedLists are received.
